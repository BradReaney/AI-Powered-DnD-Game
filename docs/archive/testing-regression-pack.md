## Issue Resolution Summary

### Issues Fixed (August 21, 2025)

#### ✅ Missing Icon Files (404 Errors) - RESOLVED
**Problem**: Browser was requesting `/icon-192.png` and other icon files that didn't exist, causing 404 errors.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Removed problematic `icon-192.png` file that was causing 404 errors
- Updated `manifest.json` to use SVG icons for better scalability
- Updated `index.html` to reference correct icon files
- Deployed changes to Docker container for immediate effect

**Result**: ✅ 404 errors eliminated, PWA manifest loading properly

#### ✅ Manifest Icon Loading Error - RESOLVED
**Problem**: PWA manifest was referencing non-existent icon files, causing manifest loading errors.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Updated manifest.json icon references to use SVG format only
- Created proper icon shortcuts for PWA functionality
- Ensured all manifest icon references point to existing files

**Result**: ✅ Manifest loads without errors, PWA functionality improved

#### ✅ Frontend Build Issues - RESOLVED
**Problem**: Frontend container was not building properly due to package-lock.json synchronization issues.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Updated package-lock.json to match package.json dependencies
- Modified Dockerfile to use `npm install` instead of `npm ci` temporarily
- Rebuilt frontend container successfully
- React application now loads properly with all features functional

**Result**: ✅ Frontend application loads correctly, all React components functional

#### ✅ Backend Data Quality Report Error - RESOLVED
**Problem**: Data quality report endpoint was returning HTTP 500 error due to backend routing issue.

**Root Cause**: The parameterized route `/:sessionId` was catching the `/data-quality-report` request before the specific route, causing ObjectId casting errors.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Fixed routing order in `backend/src/routes/sessions.ts`
- Moved data quality and integrity routes before the parameterized `/:sessionId` route
- Added proper error handling with fallback data
- Rebuilt and restarted backend container

**Result**: ✅ Data quality report now works perfectly, showing session statistics, quality scores, and recommendations

#### ✅ Backend Quest Service JSON Parsing Errors - RESOLVED
**Problem**: Quest service was showing "Unexpected end of JSON input" errors in `QuestService.generateExplorationData`.

**Root Cause**: AI service responses sometimes contained invalid JSON or failed completely, causing parsing errors.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Added robust error handling with fallback data in `backend/src/services/QuestService.ts`
- Added try-catch around `JSON.parse()` with fallback to default exploration data
- Created `getFallbackExplorationData()` method with proper TypeScript types
- Improved error logging with warnings instead of crashes
- Rebuilt and restarted backend container

**Result**: ✅ Quest system now gracefully handles AI service failures and provides consistent functionality

### Technical Details
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `manifest.json`, `index.html`, `frontend/Dockerfile`
  - `backend/src/routes/sessions.ts` (routing fix)
