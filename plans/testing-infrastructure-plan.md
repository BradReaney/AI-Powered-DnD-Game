- [x] Documented CI/CD pipeline
- [x] Added troubleshooting guides

## Phase 7: CI Environment Fixes üîß IN PROGRESS

### 7.1 Issues Identified During CI Testing ‚ùå

#### 7.1.1 Node.js Version Compatibility Issues
- **Problem**: `@shelf/jest-mongodb@5.2.2` requires Node.js >=22, but CI uses Node.js 18
- **Impact**: Frontend tests cannot start due to dependency installation failure
- **Status**: ‚ùå BLOCKING

#### 7.1.2 TypeScript Mock Implementation Issues
- **Problem**: Jest setup mocks missing required properties
  - Storage mock missing `length` and `key` properties
  - WebSocket mock missing `CONNECTING`, `OPEN`, `CLOSING`, `CLOSED` properties
- **Impact**: Frontend TypeScript compilation fails
- **Status**: ‚ùå BLOCKING

#### 7.1.3 Docker Compose Availability in CI
- **Problem**: `docker-compose` command not found in GitHub Actions runner
- **Impact**: E2E tests cannot start required services
- **Status**: ‚ùå BLOCKING

#### 7.1.4 Remaining Test Failures
- **Problem**: Some backend tests still failing due to:
  - MongoDB connection timeouts (tests trying to connect to real MongoDB instead of in-memory)
  - Validation errors in test data
- **Impact**: Reduces test success rate
- **Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è NON-BLOCKING (infrastructure working, test data issues)

### 7.2 Fix Implementation Plan üîß

#### 7.2.1 Fix Node.js Version Compatibility
- [ ] Update GitHub Actions workflow to use Node.js 20+
- [ ] Verify all dependencies are compatible with Node.js 20
- [ ] Test frontend dependency installation

#### 7.2.2 Fix TypeScript Mock Implementations
- [ ] Complete Storage mock implementation with all required properties
- [ ] Complete WebSocket mock implementation with all required properties
- [ ] Verify TypeScript compilation passes
- [ ] Test frontend quality checks

#### 7.2.3 Fix Docker Compose Availability
- [ ] Install Docker Compose in GitHub Actions runner
- [ ] Alternative: Use Docker Compose v2 (`docker compose` instead of `docker-compose`)
- [ ] Test E2E test service startup
- [ ] Verify all services can start and become healthy

#### 7.2.4 Fix Remaining Test Issues
- [ ] Investigate MongoDB connection issues in tests
- [ ] Fix test data validation errors
- [ ] Ensure tests use in-memory MongoDB properly
- [ ] Improve test data setup and teardown

### 7.3 Success Criteria for Phase 7
- [ ] All CI jobs pass successfully
- [ ] Frontend unit tests run without dependency issues
- [ ] Frontend quality checks pass TypeScript compilation
- [ ] E2E tests can start and run successfully
- [ ] Overall test success rate improves to >90%
- [ ] PR status shows ‚úÖ "All checks passed"

## Current Test Results Summary

### Backend Unit Tests ‚úÖ WORKING
- **Status**: Infrastructure working, tests executing
- **Results**: 84 passed, 36 failed (70% success rate)
- **Performance**: ~4.5 minutes execution time
- **Coverage**: Working correctly

### Frontend Unit Tests ‚ùå FAILED
- **Status**: Blocked by Node.js version compatibility
- **Issue**: Dependencies require Node.js >=22, CI uses Node.js 18
- **Fix Required**: Update CI Node.js version

### Frontend Quality Checks ‚ùå FAILED
- **Status**: Blocked by TypeScript mock implementation issues
- **Issue**: Incomplete mock implementations causing compilation errors
- **Fix Required**: Complete mock implementations

### End-to-End Tests ‚ùå FAILED
- **Status**: Blocked by Docker Compose availability
- **Issue**: `docker-compose` command not found in CI runner
- **Fix Required**: Install Docker Compose or use alternative approach

### Backend Quality Checks ‚úÖ WORKING
- **Status**: Linting and formatting working correctly
- **Performance**: 1 minute execution time

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Fix Node.js version compatibility in CI
2. **Immediate**: Complete TypeScript mock implementations
3. **Immediate**: Fix Docker Compose availability in CI
4. **Secondary**: Address remaining test failures
5. **Final**: Verify all CI jobs pass successfully

## Overall Assessment

**Testing Infrastructure Enhancement: 70% Complete**

- ‚úÖ **Core Infrastructure**: 100% Complete and Working
- ‚úÖ **Local Testing**: 100% Working
- ‚ùå **CI Environment**: 30% Working (needs fixes)
- üîß **Status**: Ready for production once CI issues resolved

The testing infrastructure we've built is solid and working locally. The CI failures are due to environment constraints and implementation details that can be systematically fixed. Once resolved, this will provide a robust, production-ready testing infrastructure.
