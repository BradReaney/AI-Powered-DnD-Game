### **Issue 6: Dice Rolling Functionality Not Implemented** - ✅ **RESOLVED**
**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED**  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Description**: The dice rolling functionality was reported as not properly implemented, but testing revealed it is fully functional.

**Root Cause**: This issue was incorrectly reported - the dice rolling system is actually fully implemented and working correctly.

**Steps to Reproduce**: 
1. In a game session, type `/roll 1d20`
2. Notice the response shows actual dice roll results

**Expected Behavior**: Should roll actual dice and show results.

**Actual Behavior**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - Dice rolling system works correctly, showing actual roll results with proper formatting.

**Impact**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - Core D&D dice rolling functionality is working correctly.

**Debugging Strategy**:
- ✅ **COMPLETED** - Check slash commands implementation for roll command
- ✅ **COMPLETED** - Verify dice rolling logic is implemented
- ✅ **COMPLETED** - Review backend dice rolling service
- ✅ **COMPLETED** - Test dice rolling functionality end-to-end

**Resolution**: The dice rolling functionality is fully implemented and working correctly. The system includes:
- Frontend slash command handling (`/roll <dice>`)
- Complete dice rolling logic with support for modifiers (e.g., "3d6+2")
- Proper result formatting with individual roll results
- Backend dice rolling endpoints
- AI integration for dice roll responses
- UI components with animations and roll history

**Test Results**: Successfully tested `/roll 1d20` which returned "🎲 Rolling 1d20: 1 (1)" - confirming the system is working correctly.

### **Issue 7: Character Extraction System Extracting Non-Character Names** - 🟡 **PARTIALLY RESOLVED**
**Status**: 🟡 **PARTIALLY RESOLVED**  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Description**: The character extraction system was extracting non-character names like "Learned", "His", "Perhaps", "Her", "Welcome" instead of only extracting actual character names.

**Root Cause**: The character extraction logic in the backend was using regex patterns that were too broad and catching common words that start with capital letters.

**Steps to Reproduce**: 
1. Start a game session and have AI generate responses
2. Notice that the discovery system shows names like "Learned", "His", "Perhaps"
3. These are not actual character names

**Expected Behavior**: Should only extract actual character names like "Elara", "Thrain Ironbeard", etc.

**Actual Behavior**: Extracts common words that start with capital letters.

**Impact**: Discovery system is polluted with false positives, making it harder to track actual characters.

**Debugging Strategy**:
- Check character extraction regex patterns in backend
- Verify the filtering logic for common words
- Review the AI prompt for character extraction
- Check for missing validation in character extraction

**Remediation Steps Taken**:
1. ✅ **Improved regex patterns** - Made character extraction patterns more specific
2. ✅ **Expanded exclusion list** - Added more common words to filter out
3. ✅ **Enhanced filtering logic** - Added context-aware filtering to distinguish character names from common words
4. ✅ **Backend rebuild** - Applied changes and restarted backend container

**Current Status**: 🟡 **PARTIALLY RESOLVED** - System now primarily uses LLM-based extraction and no longer extracts most false positives like "Learned", "His", "Her", "Perhaps", "Welcome". However, there's still some room for improvement in name parsing (e.g., extracting "Sylvan" separately from "Sylvan Whisperwind").

**Remaining Issues**:
- Minor name parsing improvements needed for compound names
- System is now working significantly better with LLM-based extraction as primary method

### **Issue 8: Character Update Logic for Existing Characters** - ✅ **RESOLVED**
**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED**  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Description**: When a character or location is extracted but already exists in the system, the system should update the details with any altered information such as description or stats, but this logic may not be working properly.

**Root Cause**: This issue was incorrectly reported - the character update logic is fully implemented and working correctly.

**Steps to Reproduce**: 
1. Have AI mention an existing character in a new context
2. Check if the character's information is updated with new details
3. Verify if location information is updated with new details

**Expected Behavior**: Existing characters and locations should be updated with new information when mentioned again.

**Actual Behavior**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - Character and location update logic is working correctly, properly merging new information with existing data.

**Impact**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - Character and location information is properly updated to reflect story developments.

**Debugging Strategy**:
- ✅ **COMPLETED** - Check character update logic in gameplay routes
- ✅ **COMPLETED** - Verify the updateCharacter method in CharacterService
- ✅ **COMPLETED** - Review the location update logic
- ✅ **COMPLETED** - Check for proper data merging when updating existing entities

**Resolution**: The character update logic is fully implemented and working correctly. The system includes:
- Proper change detection between previous and current character data
- Automatic merging of new information with existing character records
- Detailed tracking of what specific changes were made
- Confidence scoring for updates (e.g., "Confidence: 85%")
- Method tracking (LLM-based vs. regex-based extraction)
- Location update functionality for world state tracking

**Test Results**: Successfully observed character updates in the session:
- "Character Updated: Sylvan Whisperwind" with background and personality updates
- "Character Updated: Thrain Ironbeard" with character information refreshed
- "Location Updated: Forest" and "Location Updated: Castle Blackstone" with location information refreshed

**Implementation Details**:
- Backend: `CharacterService.updateCharacter()` method with proper data merging
- Frontend: Slash command support for character updates (`/update character`)
- Gameplay Routes: Automatic character/location update detection during AI responses
- Change Tracking: Detailed logging of what information was updated

### **Issue 9: Discovery Message System Missing Update Notifications** - ✅ **RESOLVED**
**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED**  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Description**: The discovery message system needs to show both "New X Discovered" and "X was updated" messages with details about what changed.

**Current Status**: 
- ✅ Backend logic implemented for tracking changes and generating update messages
- ✅ Frontend display logic implemented for showing update notifications
- ✅ Character updates working correctly with detailed change tracking
- ✅ Location updates working correctly with detailed change tracking

**Resolution**: The discovery message system is now fully functional and working correctly. The system properly:
