## 🔴 **Active Issues**

### **Issue 1: Start Adventure Button Disabled** ✅ **RESOLVED**
**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - Start Adventure button now works correctly  
**Priority**: 🟡 **MEDIUM**  
**Last Updated**: 2025-09-03  
**Current Tester**: AI Assistant  

**Description**:  
When creating a new game session, after selecting both a campaign and character, the "Start Adventure" button remains disabled and cannot be clicked. This prevents users from starting new game sessions.

**Root Cause**:  
The issue was caused by the frontend not properly fetching characters from the backend. The character data was not being loaded, so the campaign-character association logic was failing.

**Resolution**:  
The issue was resolved by ensuring that:
1. Character data is properly fetched from the backend API
2. The character-campaign association is working correctly
3. The CampaignCharacterSelector component properly validates both selections

**Testing Results**:  
- Campaign selection works correctly
- Character selection works correctly  
- Both selections are displayed in the UI
- Start Adventure button is now enabled when both are selected
- Screenshot captured: issue1-start-adventure-fixed.png

**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED**

### **Issue 2: Character Edit Error** ✅ **RESOLVED**
**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - Character editing now works without errors  
**Priority**: 🔴 **HIGH**  
**Last Updated**: 2025-09-03  
**Current Tester**: AI Assistant  

**Description**:  
When clicking the "Edit" button on a character, the application crashes with a client-side exception. The error message shows "TypeError: (S.equipment || []).join is not a function" indicating a JavaScript error in the character editing functionality.

**Root Cause**:  
The equipment field in the character form was not properly validated as an array before calling the `.join()` method. This caused a TypeError when the equipment field was undefined or not an array.

**Resolution**:  
Fixed by adding proper array validation in the character form component:
1. Added `Array.isArray()` checks for equipment and spells fields in form initialization
2. Added safety checks in the form rendering to ensure equipment is always treated as an array
3. Updated the form to handle cases where equipment might be undefined or not an array

**Testing Results**:  
- Character list displays correctly
- Edit button is clickable
- Character edit form now loads without errors
- Equipment and spells tabs work correctly
- Screenshot captured: issue2-character-edit-fixed.png

**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED**

### **Issue 3: Missing Session Messages API Endpoint** ✅ **RESOLVED**
**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - Session messages API endpoint now working correctly  
**Priority**: 🔴 **HIGH**  
**Last Updated**: 2025-09-03  
**Current Tester**: AI Assistant  

**Description**:  
When trying to load a game session, the frontend was attempting to fetch messages from `/api/sessions/{sessionId}/messages` but this endpoint did not exist in the backend, causing 500 errors and preventing the session interface from loading properly.

**Root Cause**:  
The backend was missing the API endpoint to retrieve session messages, even though the Message model and message saving functionality existed.

**Resolution**:  
Added the missing `/api/sessions/:sessionId/messages` endpoint to the backend sessions route:
1. Created GET endpoint that accepts sessionId parameter
2. Added proper validation for sessionId
3. Used the existing Message.getSessionMessages static method
4. Added proper error handling and response formatting

**Testing Results**:  
- Session messages endpoint now returns proper JSON response
- Frontend can successfully fetch session messages
- Session interface loads without errors
- Screenshot captured: phase3-session-created.png

**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED**

### **Issue 4: Active Sessions Route Order Conflict** ✅ **RESOLVED**
**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - Active sessions endpoint now working correctly  
**Priority**: 🔴 **HIGH**  
**Last Updated**: 2025-09-03  
**Current Tester**: AI Assistant  

**Description**:  
The `/api/sessions/active` endpoint was returning 404 errors because Express was treating "active" as a sessionId parameter due to incorrect route ordering. The `/:sessionId` route was defined before the `/active` route, causing route conflicts.

**Root Cause**:  
Express routes are matched in the order they are defined. The `/:sessionId` route was catching the `/active` request and trying to find a session with ID "active", which doesn't exist.

**Resolution**:  
Fixed the route order by moving the `/active` route before the `/:sessionId` route:
1. Moved `/active` route to line 266 (before `/:sessionId` route)
2. Removed duplicate `/active` route that was later in the file
3. Added comment explaining the route order requirement

**Testing Results**:  
- Active sessions endpoint now returns proper session data
- Play tab correctly displays active sessions
- Session continuation functionality works
- Screenshot captured: phase3-active-session-displayed.png

**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED**

### **Issue 5: Session Activity Update 400 Error** ✅ **RESOLVED**
**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - Session activity updates now working correctly
**Priority**: 🟡 **LOW**
**Last Updated**: 2025-09-03
**Current Tester**: AI Assistant

**Description**:
When sending messages in the game session, there were 400 errors when trying to update session activity. The error appeared in the console as "Failed to update session activity: Error: HTTP error! status: 400" but did not affect core gameplay functionality.

**Root Cause**:
The frontend was using "current" as a fallback sessionId when no messages existed, but the backend expected a valid UUID format. The sessionId "current" was not a valid UUID format, causing the 400 error.

**Resolution**:
Fixed the frontend code in `game-chat.tsx` to use the `existingSessionId` prop instead of "current" as the fallback when no messages exist. This ensures that a valid UUID is always passed to the session activity update endpoint.

**Changes Made**:
1. Updated `addMessage` function to use `existingSessionId` instead of "current"
2. Updated `handleSendMessage` function to use `existingSessionId` instead of `null`
3. Updated AI response section to use `existingSessionId` instead of `null`

**Testing Results**:
- Session activity updates now work correctly
- No more 400 errors in console
- AI responses work correctly
- Character and location discovery works
- Game commands (/help, /status, /roll, /inventory) work perfectly
- Chat functionality is fully operational
- Screenshot captured: phase4-ai-commands-working.png

**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED**
