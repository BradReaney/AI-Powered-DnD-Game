## Debugging Issues (Pre-Implementation)

### Critical Issues to Resolve
1. **Session Creation UI Issue**
   - "Start Adventure" button remains disabled
   - Prevents testing story progression
   - Blocks gameplay functionality

2. **Campaign Data Loading Issues**
   - Inconsistent data loading behavior
   - Requires manual refresh
   - Affects user experience

3. **Character Selection Issues**
   - Selection doesn't always register
   - Campaign selection resets unexpectedly
   - Form state management problems

## Implementation Approach

### Development Strategy
- **Incremental Implementation**: Build features incrementally
- **Parallel Development**: Develop and test in parallel
- **Early Testing**: Start testing early in each phase
- **Performance Monitoring**: Monitor performance throughout

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: 90%+ coverage for new code
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end functionality testing
- **Performance Tests**: Benchmark and optimization testing
- **Manual Testing**: User experience and story quality testing

### Quality Assurance
