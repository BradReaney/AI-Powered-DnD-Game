## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Complexity**: Story arc system is complex
- **Integration**: Integration with existing systems
- **Performance**: Performance impact of new features

### Medium Risk
- **Timeline**: 6-week timeline is aggressive
- **Testing**: Comprehensive testing requirements
- **Quality**: Maintaining code quality under timeline pressure

### Low Risk
- **Resources**: Single developer can focus
- **Scope**: Well-defined scope and requirements
- **Technology**: Using familiar technologies

## Risk Mitigation

### Complexity Risk
- Break down complex features into smaller tasks
- Use incremental implementation approach
- Start with simple implementations and enhance

### Integration Risk
- Test integration points early
- Use mock services for isolated testing
- Implement features incrementally

### Performance Risk
- Monitor performance throughout development
- Implement performance testing early
- Optimize as you go, not just at the end

### Timeline Risk
- Start testing early in each phase
- Use parallel development and testing
- Focus on core features, defer enhancements
