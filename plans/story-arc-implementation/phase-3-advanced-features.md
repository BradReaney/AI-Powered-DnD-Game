   - Maintain story coherence across branches
2. Implement choice tracking system:
   - Player choice recording
   - Choice consequences tracking
   - Story branch management
   - Path convergence handling
3. Add narrative branching logic:
   - Story path selection based on choices
   - Branch-specific content generation
   - Story coherence across branches
   - Branch merging and resolution

**Testing Requirements:**
- Unit tests for branching logic
- Integration tests with story progression
- Choice consequence tests
- Story coherence tests

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Story branches based on player choices
- Choices have meaningful consequences
- Story remains coherent across branches
- Branch management is efficient

### Task 4: Performance Optimization
**Duration**: 2 days  
**Priority**: Medium

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Optimize context management:
   - Implement context caching
   - Optimize database queries
   - Add performance monitoring
   - Implement lazy loading
2. Enhance story arc performance:
   - Optimize story progression tracking
   - Improve validation performance
   - Add performance benchmarks
   - Implement performance alerts
3. Add scalability features:
   - Handle larger campaigns
   - Support more complex storylines
   - Optimize memory usage
   - Improve response times

**Testing Requirements:**
- Performance tests for all optimizations
- Scalability tests with large campaigns
- Memory usage tests
- Response time tests

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Performance benchmarks are met
- Scalability targets are achieved
- Memory usage is optimized
