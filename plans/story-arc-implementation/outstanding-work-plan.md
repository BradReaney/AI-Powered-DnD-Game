**Issue**: Story beat suggestions are empty or low quality
**Impact**: Reduced story arc functionality

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Analyze current LLM prompts for story beat generation
- [ ] Improve prompt engineering for better suggestions
- [ ] Test and validate improved prompts
- [ ] Add fallback mechanisms for poor suggestions

**Estimated Effort**: 3-5 days

#### 6. Complete Integration Testing
**Issue**: Some integration points not fully tested
**Impact**: Potential runtime issues

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Test story arc creation with real campaigns
- [ ] Verify character milestone tracking integration
- [ ] Test quest-story integration workflows
- [ ] Validate context management with story arcs
- [ ] Test performance optimization features

**Estimated Effort**: 1 week

### üîµ **LOW PRIORITY**

#### 7. Documentation Updates
**Issue**: Some API endpoints need better documentation
**Impact**: Developer experience and maintenance

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Complete API documentation for story arc endpoints
- [ ] Add code comments for complex story arc logic
- [ ] Create user guide for story arc features
- [ ] Document integration patterns and best practices

**Estimated Effort**: 3-5 days

#### 8. Performance Monitoring
**Issue**: No performance monitoring for story arc features
**Impact**: Potential performance issues not detected

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Add performance metrics for story arc operations
- [ ] Implement monitoring for context management
- [ ] Add alerts for performance degradation
- [ ] Create performance dashboards

**Estimated Effort**: 1 week

## Conclusion

The story arc implementation has a solid backend foundation with all three phases completed. The main outstanding work focuses on:

1. **Critical bug fixes** (story validation)
2. **Frontend integration** (UI implementation)
3. **Test completion** (enabling disabled tests)
4. **User experience** (making features accessible)

With focused effort over 8 weeks, the story arc system can be fully operational and provide significant value to users of the AI DnD game.

The backend implementation demonstrates that the technical challenges have been solved - the remaining work is primarily integration, testing, and user experience focused.
