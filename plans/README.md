### ðŸ”„ Recent Refactoring (August 28, 2025)

#### Redis Cache Clearing Implementation
**Status**: âœ… COMPLETED

**Problem**: The application needed a method to automatically clear Redis cache during Railway deployments to ensure data consistency and optimal performance after code updates.

**Solution**: Implemented comprehensive Redis cache clearing functionality with automatic startup clearing, deployment-specific clearing, and pattern-based cache invalidation.

**Changes Made**:
1. **CacheService Updates**: Added environment variable integration and Railway deployment detection
2. **New API Endpoints**: Created `/api/cache/clear-deployment` for selective cache clearing
3. **Railway Configuration**: Updated `backend/railway.json` with cache management variables
4. **Deployment Script**: Created `scripts/railway-cache-clear.sh` for manual cache management
5. **GitHub Actions**: Added workflow for post-deployment cache management

**Key Features**:
- **Automatic Startup Clearing**: Cache clears when `CACHE_CLEAR_ON_STARTUP=true`
- **Deployment Clearing**: Cache clears when `CLEAR_CACHE_ON_DEPLOY=true`
- **Pattern-Based Clearing**: Selective cache invalidation with configurable patterns
- **Railway Integration**: Automatically detects Railway deployment environment
- **Cache Warming**: Restores common data after clearing for optimal performance

**Benefits**:
- Ensures data consistency after deployments
- Improves application performance with fresh cache
- Reduces database load through intelligent caching
- Provides multiple deployment strategies (automatic, manual, script-based)
- Maintains optimal cache performance during Railway deployments

**Testing Results**:
- âœ… All cache endpoints working correctly
- âœ… Cache clearing and warming functionality verified
- âœ… Deployment script executes successfully
- âœ… Railway configuration properly updated
- âœ… Local testing completed successfully

**Files Modified**:
- `backend/src/services/CacheService.ts`
- `backend/src/app.ts`
- `backend/railway.json`
- `scripts/railway-cache-clear.sh`
- `.github/workflows/railway-post-deploy.yml`
- `plans/redis-cache-clearing-implementation.md` (new)

#### Character-Campaign Linking Refactor
**Status**: âœ… COMPLETED

**Problem**: The original system required characters to be linked to sessions, which caused automatic session creation every time a character was created. This was inefficient and created unnecessary session clutter.

**Solution**: Refactored the character system to link characters directly to campaigns instead of sessions. Characters can now be created without requiring a session, and sessions are only created when needed for actual gameplay.

**Changes Made**:
1. **Character Model**: Made `sessionId` optional in the Character schema
2. **CharacterService**: Removed session validation and session-related logic from character creation methods
3. **Character Routes**: Removed automatic session creation logic when creating characters
4. **Database Indexes**: Updated indexes to reflect campaign-centric character linking

**Benefits**:
- Characters can be created independently of sessions
- No more automatic session creation during character creation
- Cleaner separation of concerns between character management and session management
- Sessions are only created when needed for actual gameplay
- Better performance and reduced database clutter

**Testing Results**:
- âœ… Characters can be created without sessions
- âœ… Characters are properly linked to campaigns
- âœ… No automatic sessions are created
- âœ… Existing functionality is preserved
- âœ… API endpoints work correctly

**Files Modified**:
- `backend/src/models/Character.ts`
- `backend/src/services/CharacterService.ts`
- `backend/src/routes/characters.ts`
