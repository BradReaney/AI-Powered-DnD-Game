#### Character and Location Delete Functionality Implementation
**Status**: âœ… COMPLETED

**Problem**: The application lacked a method to delete saved characters and locations from the UI. Users needed the ability to remove unwanted or obsolete characters and locations to maintain clean data.

**Solution**: Implemented comprehensive delete functionality across all three required locations with proper confirmation dialogs, API integration, and UI updates.

**Changes Made**:
1. **Frontend API Routes**: Created dynamic Next.js API routes for character and location deletion
   - `/api/characters/[characterId]/route.ts` - Handles character deletion
   - `/api/locations/[locationId]/route.ts` - Handles location deletion
2. **Homepage Character Tab**: Added delete buttons with trash icons to character cards
3. **Campaign Management Characters**: Added delete functionality to campaign character management
4. **Campaign Management Locations**: Added delete functionality to campaign location management
5. **Component Updates**: Enhanced CharacterSheet and LocationDetail components with delete capabilities
6. **Delete Handlers**: Implemented proper confirmation dialogs and error handling

**Key Features**:
- **Confirmation Dialogs**: User confirmation before deletion with clear warning messages
- **Visual Indicators**: Trash icons and "Delete" text on all delete buttons
- **Proper API Integration**: Uses Next.js API routes as proxy to backend services
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages

#### Character Name Similarity Detection Implementation
**Status**: âœ… COMPLETED

**Problem**: The application was creating duplicate character records when the same person was referenced with slightly different names (e.g., "The old man", "Old Finnan", "Finnan"). This caused character clutter and inconsistent data.

**Solution**: Implemented intelligent character name similarity detection that can identify when different name references refer to the same person, using both similarity matching and progressive identification algorithms.

**Changes Made**:
1. **New Service**: Created `CharacterNameSimilarityService` with progressive identification logic
2. **CharacterService Integration**: Updated to use similarity detection when finding existing characters
3. **Gameplay Route Updates**: Modified character processing to use similarity detection instead of exact name matching
4. **Configuration**: Added environment variables for tuning similarity thresholds
5. **Comprehensive Testing**: Created extensive test suite covering all scenarios

**Key Features**:
- **Progressive Identification**: Detects generic descriptions progressing to specific names (e.g., "The old man" â†’ "Finnan")
- **Similarity Matching**: Uses edit distance and pattern recognition for name variations
- **Configurable Thresholds**: Adjustable confidence levels via environment variables
- **Multiple Match Types**: Supports exact, similarity, and progressive matching
- **Intelligent Scoring**: Combines multiple factors for accurate character identification

**Benefits**:
- Eliminates duplicate character records
- Maintains character continuity across story progression
- Improves data quality and consistency
- Reduces manual character management overhead
- Provides flexible matching for various naming patterns

**Testing Results**:
- âœ… All 26 unit tests passing
- âœ… Progressive identification working correctly
- âœ… Similarity matching functioning properly
- âœ… findBestNameMatch returning appropriate results
- âœ… Confidence thresholds working as expected

**Files Modified**:
- `backend/src/services/CharacterNameSimilarityService.ts` (new)
- `backend/src/services/CharacterService.ts`
- `backend/src/routes/gameplay.ts`
- `backend/tests/CharacterNameSimilarityService.test.ts` (new)
- `config/env.example`

**Environment Variables Added**:
- `CHARACTER_SIMILARITY_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD`: Minimum confidence for matches (default: 70)
- `CHARACTER_SIMILARITY_MIN_SCORE`: Minimum similarity score (default: 60)
- `CHARACTER_SIMILARITY_MAX_EDIT_DISTANCE_SHORT`: Max edit distance for short names (default: 2)
- `CHARACTER_SIMILARITY_MAX_EDIT_DISTANCE_LONG`: Max edit distance for long names (default: 3)

### ðŸ”„ Recent Refactoring (August 28, 2025)

#### Redis Cache Clearing Implementation
**Status**: âœ… COMPLETED

**Problem**: The application needed a method to automatically clear Redis cache during Railway deployments to ensure data consistency and optimal performance after code updates.

**Solution**: Implemented comprehensive Redis cache clearing functionality with automatic startup clearing, deployment-specific clearing, and pattern-based cache invalidation.

**Changes Made**:
1. **CacheService Updates**: Added environment variable integration and Railway deployment detection
2. **New API Endpoints**: Created `/api/cache/clear-deployment` for selective cache clearing
3. **Railway Configuration**: Updated `backend/railway.json` with cache management variables
4. **Deployment Script**: Created `scripts/railway-cache-clear.sh` for manual cache management
5. **GitHub Actions**: Added workflow for post-deployment cache management

**Key Features**:
- **Automatic Startup Clearing**: Cache clears when `CACHE_CLEAR_ON_STARTUP=true`
- **Deployment Clearing**: Cache clears when `CLEAR_CACHE_ON_DEPLOY=true`
- **Pattern-Based Clearing**: Selective cache invalidation with configurable patterns
- **Railway Integration**: Automatically detects Railway deployment environment
- **Cache Warming**: Restores common data after clearing for optimal performance

**Benefits**:
- Ensures data consistency after deployments
- Improves application performance with fresh cache
- Reduces database load through intelligent caching
- Provides multiple deployment strategies (automatic, manual, script-based)
- Maintains optimal cache performance during Railway deployments

**Testing Results**:
- âœ… All cache endpoints working correctly
- âœ… Cache clearing and warming functionality verified
- âœ… Deployment script executes successfully
- âœ… Railway configuration properly updated

- `backend/railway.json`
- `scripts/railway-cache-clear.sh`
- `.github/workflows/railway-post-deploy.yml`
- `plans/redis-cache-clearing-implementation.md` (new)

#### Character-Campaign Linking Refactor
**Status**: âœ… COMPLETED

**Problem**: The original system required characters to be linked to sessions, which caused automatic session creation every time a character was created. This was inefficient and created unnecessary session clutter.

**Solution**: Refactored the character system to link characters directly to campaigns instead of sessions. Characters can now be created without requiring a session, and sessions are only created when needed for actual gameplay.

**Changes Made**:
1. **Character Model**: Made `sessionId` optional in the Character schema
2. **CharacterService**: Removed session validation and session-related logic from character creation methods
3. **Character Routes**: Removed automatic session creation logic when creating characters
4. **Database Indexes**: Updated indexes to reflect campaign-centric character linking

**Benefits**:
- Characters can be created independently of sessions
- No more automatic session creation during character creation
- Cleaner separation of concerns between character management and session management
- Sessions are only created when needed for actual gameplay
- Better performance and reduced database clutter

**Testing Results**:
- âœ… Characters can be created without sessions
- âœ… Characters are properly linked to campaigns
- âœ… No automatic sessions are created
- âœ… Existing functionality is preserved
- âœ… API endpoints work correctly

**Files Modified**:
- `backend/src/models/Character.ts`
- `backend/src/services/CharacterService.ts`
- `backend/src/routes/characters.ts`
