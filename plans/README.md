- Comprehensive testing framework

### ðŸ”„ Recent Refactoring (August 28, 2025)

#### Character-Campaign Linking Refactor
**Status**: âœ… COMPLETED

**Problem**: The original system required characters to be linked to sessions, which caused automatic session creation every time a character was created. This was inefficient and created unnecessary session clutter.

**Solution**: Refactored the character system to link characters directly to campaigns instead of sessions. Characters can now be created without requiring a session, and sessions are only created when needed for actual gameplay.

**Changes Made**:
1. **Character Model**: Made `sessionId` optional in the Character schema
2. **CharacterService**: Removed session validation and session-related logic from character creation methods
3. **Character Routes**: Removed automatic session creation logic when creating characters
4. **Database Indexes**: Updated indexes to reflect campaign-centric character linking

**Benefits**:
- Characters can be created independently of sessions
- No more automatic session creation during character creation
- Cleaner separation of concerns between character management and session management
- Sessions are only created when needed for actual gameplay
- Better performance and reduced database clutter

**Testing Results**:
- âœ… Characters can be created without sessions
- âœ… Characters are properly linked to campaigns
- âœ… No automatic sessions are created
- âœ… Existing functionality is preserved
- âœ… API endpoints work correctly

**Files Modified**:
- `backend/src/models/Character.ts`
- `backend/src/services/CharacterService.ts`
- `backend/src/routes/characters.ts`
