You will need to test your own work;

1. Use the Context7 MCP to look up relevant information for the task
2. Use docker compose to start, stop and build the app.
3. Use the Playwright MCP to investigate any requests and test any changes.
4. Use the Postman MCP to check API requests and responses
5. A .env file has already been created with the correct details so don't create a new one.
6. Ensure you check the plans as you progress / complete work and update them at key stages
7. Once you've finished and satisfied everything works, clean up any unused or debugging code you created during the development.


Lets run through the regression pack found here - @comprehensive-testing-plan.md
