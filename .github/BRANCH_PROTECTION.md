# 🛡️ Branch Protection Rules Setup

To maintain our **100% quality score**, set up these branch protection rules in GitHub:

## 🔒 Main Branch Protection

### Required Status Checks
Enable these status checks as required before merging:

1. **`backend-quality`** - Backend quality checks
2. **`frontend-quality`** - Frontend quality checks  
3. **`e2e-tests`** - End-to-end tests
4. **`docker-build`** - Docker build verification

### Settings
- ✅ **Require status checks to pass before merging**
- ✅ **Require branches to be up to date before merging**
- ✅ **Require conversation resolution before merging**
- ✅ **Require signed commits** (optional but recommended)
- ✅ **Require linear history** (optional but recommended)

## 🚫 Restrictions

- **Restrict pushes that create files that are larger than 100 MB**
- **Block force pushes**
- **Block deletions**

## 📋 How to Set Up

1. Go to **Settings** → **Branches**
2. Click **Add rule** for `main` branch
3. Configure the above settings
4. Save changes

## 🔄 Develop Branch Protection

This ensures our project maintains its **PERFECT 100/100 quality score**! 🎉
