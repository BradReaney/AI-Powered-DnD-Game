You will need to test your own work;

1. Use docker compose to start, stop and build the app.
2. Use the Playwright MCP to investigate any requests and test any changes.
3. A .env file has already been created with the correct details.
4. Once you've finished and satisfied everything works, clean up any unused or debugging code you created during the development.
